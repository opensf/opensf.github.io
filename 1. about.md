<p><strong>Why do we exist?</strong></p>

There are these great scientists and Nobel laureates who, when asked about their major inspiration, talk about their passionate teachers and professors. Rarely are their teachers known but passion about their subject is almost always a prominent feature. And passion is contagious. It inspires. 

India lacks passionate and high quality science teachers. It is one of the most serious issues today. We are on a mission to connect teachers who are deeply motivated about their subjects and are highly skilled with students.  OSF was founded on the premises that student performance can be improved alongwith their understanding of subject in a very short period of time only if the teachers who teach the subject are deeply passionate themselves.

We have known the impact of such teachers on students first hand. The boost they provide to students performance. The quality of education they impart.
OSF provides platform to allow this wonderful magic to happen.


<strong>What we do?</strong>

Our team is small, diverse and very competent in their respective subjects. Their major focus is to guide the learning process using researched pedagogical tools and ensure the state board content is well supplemented with relevant examples and demonstrations. We whole-heartedly promote deep conversations about the subjects being taught and do everything so that the context and content of conversation remains relevant to our students. 

At Open Science Forum we practice the philosophy we stated above. We use highly researched learning methodologies to teach students. We continuously monitor their subject mastery, tweak our content delivery to the need of the hour.

We are known for our ability to cater to a diverse group of students and enhance their results. We teach GSEB students, CBSE Students and ISC students. 

<strong>Does it Work?</strong>

Our research shows that our methodology increases our students' engagement levels and leads to better understanding and hence more marks. We have witnessed significant increase in their overall enthusiasm about the subjects.
