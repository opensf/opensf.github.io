title: This Website

This website has two sections which are not differentiated as you would have noticed. The links you see in the yellow sidebar constitute this 'website'. It is primarily to communicate the usual information about us like who we are and how to reach us. 

The other more prominent section is the blog which is what you will primarily see on the home page. This is where we put up useful content - solution to textbook numericals, science stories and all.

One simple way to find out if you are looking at a 'page' or a 'post' is to look for newer and older buttons at the bottom of the page.

This website runs on jekyll and uses a theme called Hyde made by Mark Otto. The combination and general styling is heavily inspired by work of Julian Thilo.
